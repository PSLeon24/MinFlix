# MinFlix
The project creating a movie review web service with react

## Learning Notes
### Create a react app
- <code>npx create-react-app minflix</code>
### Run server
- <code>npm start</code>

## Review
- Component: It's similar to a function in javascript. After it take "props" as input, it returns React element describing how it expresses on the screen.
  - Always have to write <code>import React from 'react';</code> on first line in new js file. and write <code>export default Component Name</code> on last line
    - Unless write it above, react can't understand jsx.
  - <code>import Component Name from './ComponentFileName'</code>
  - The first letter of the component's name must start uppercase.
- JSX: Grammar combining JavaScript and HTML
- props: It's data to transfer between components. Using this is efficient to reuse components.
